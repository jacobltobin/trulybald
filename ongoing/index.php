			<p>"The possibilities that a concerted human strike could uncover are virtually unlimited. We cannot know what could happen if we did agree to change ourselves and change each other, because the very categories at our disposal today aren’t the ones we will use in this possible future. Human strike will change the way we have to apprehend it, it will be a psychosomatic transformation, extremely difficult to criminalise and extremely contaminating. It will not happen through mysticism, through alternative techniques of the self, through a specific training, through the reappropriation of violence, but it might also happen because of these practices, although it will not be their direct result. What is at stake is the discovery of a new intimacy with ourselves that will make us resistant to cruelty and retaliation as much as lucid in front of abuses, flexible and detached, freed from the need to follow instructions or leaders. The experience of unlearning, which is necessary to spark this change, will require the abandonment of all superstitions, including the belief in revolution or the possibility of communism as it has been dreamt of through the past couple of centuries. The refusal to reproduce models of the past, to represent a position or a group, will bring a new abstraction, a new imageless practice on the scene of politics, which will connect us to the consciousness that human strike is already happening, that it happens all the time, that we just need to listen to it and play it, like one plays in an orchestra or on a stage, as we all have a place in it. And the human strike needs us as much as we need it."</p>

			<p>"We want to move away from thinking about change as primarily effected through events. To focus on the role of events is to foreground particular moments when a set of material, social and imaginary ruptures come together and produce a break in the flow of history – a new truth. Much of the twentieth century’s political thinking casts revolt and revolution as the most central events in creating social change. But the (left’s) fixation on events cannot nurture the productive energy required to challenge the formation of contemporary modes of control in Global North Atlantic societies. An event is never in the present; it can only be designated as an event in retrospect or anticipated as a future possibility. To pin our hopes on events is a nominalist move which draws on the masculinist luxury of having the power both to name things and to wait about for salvation. Because events are never in the present, if we highlight their role in social change we do so at the expense of considering the potence of the present that is made of people’s everyday practices: the practices employed to navigate daily life and to sustain relations, the practices which are at the heart of social transformation long before we are able to name it as such"</p>

			<p>bourriaud (horribly probably triple misquoted and poorly retranslated from a facebook comment) "What is customarily called reality has no more consistency than a montage. thus we could see artistic practice as a kind of software action to be performed on communal reality that produces alternative versions of the same... and in doing so it illuminates the montages constituting 'reality'. this runs contrary to ideology - which proclaims the political and economic framework we live in to be immutable and definitive. It is because social reality constitutes an artifact from the inside and out that we can imagine changing it. Dislocate, disassemble, disorder, and poiesis. By producing representations and counter-models that underscore the intrinsic fragility of the standing order, art bears the standard of a political project that is much more efficient than if it simply relayed a watchword or ideology."</p>

			<p>ben v: "" "Conventional wisdom" and "common sense" are political tools. Nothing is "just the way things are". We all do countless things each day for no other reason than "that's what people do". I think that changing this is the first step (out of many many many) towards changing the massive inequalities and injustices in our world. I believe that creativity and art can play a big role in that. New art creates new perspectives and new perspectives can shape a new world. But I don't believe it's a matter of a person or group of people making a "great piece of art" that changes people's minds. I think it's a matter of each and every person getting involved on a participatory level in creativity. And not just in the traditional arts, music, film, etc, but taking a creative approach to life itself. Cooking, washing dishes, taking a walk, etc are all opportunities for creativity and an artistic approach. I think that by taking an artistic approach to everything it is possible to break the spell of conventional wisdom and common sense, and to "create" a world that is actually grounded in reality and human potential rather than greed and fear. I think it's time to take Art out of the capitalist concept of creating a "product" or "result" that is somehow better or more worthy than the other "products", and take Art into the real world.

			<p>"There is no lever to press, there is nowhere to situate our bodies to SHUT IT DOWN, no canal or bridge to stand on, no car to stand in front of. Where have all the bigots gone? They are no longer visible. They are no longer ‘they’. Only the bigoted residue within us. Caked onto our bones. The problem needs to be purged. Fuck the system. Which system do we fuck? [...] You cannot take on the clusterfuck of systems as a whole so go ahead and start fucking the one that you are most implicated in. Recognizing the problems with all these different systems is important. But recognize to learn. Recognize to piece together. Recognize the intersections. Recognize where these systems are located inside of you. Recognize that recognizing does nothing on its own. Recognize that because all the systems are entangled forming a super system, fucking your local system helps to push towards the collapse of all systems." </p>
